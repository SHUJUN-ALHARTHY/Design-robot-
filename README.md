Reason for choosing the tool:
Because my laptop was broken, I executed the design task on Tinkercad from my iPad because it runs in the browser and doesn't require installation.

Steps in order (brief):
1. I opened the Tinkercad website and logged in. I created a new 3D Design project.
2. I built the arm base using a large cylinder (representing stability on the table).
3. I added a small cylinder above it as the base rotation joint (DOF 1).
4. I created the first arm (shoulder) using a long box and connected it to the joint (up/down movement = DOF 2).
5. At the end of the first arm, I added a small cylinder as the elbow joint, then a second box as the middle arm (forward/backward movement = DOF 3).
6. At the end of the second arm, I added a small wrist joint, then a short piece representing the wrist forearms (up/down movement = DOF 4).
7. I added a circular piece at the end for wrist rotation, or a simple gripper made of two opposite box pieces (DOF 5).
8. I used Align to align the parts and Group to assemble each link with its joint.
9. I experimented with Rotate/Move for each part to simulate the five movements (a formal simulation without physics).
